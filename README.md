This is [a demo](http://blog.fullystacked.it/demo-live-preview/) to an article  ["Configurator with a live preview of a personalised product in AngularJS"](http://blog.fullystacked.it/live-preview-personalisation-configurator-angularjs/) 

Being a demo this code might be incomplete etc.

All the important stuff happens in app.js, index.html and directives.

Usage of Gulp and its plugins is not necessary. It's for live reload and to serve files which you can simply open from your local drive.
